Contributing
------------

We love pull requests from everyone.
In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Remember to write a [good commit message][commit].

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest version before making a pull request!
